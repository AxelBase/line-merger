Press A to accept it and instantly move to the next pending hunk. Press R to reject and move on. The Final Result updates with every keystroke — you see the merged file take shape in real time.</p> <h3 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Why This Is Fast</h3> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Most reviews follow a clear pattern: accept most changes, reject a few outliers. With keyboard shortcuts you never move your hands from the home row. A large pull request with dozens of hunks can be reviewed in under a minute.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Advanced Tips</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Combine shortcuts with the view toggle button for maximum speed: start in Side-by-Side to understand layout, switch to Inline, then hammer A and R until done. Use “Use as Base” between iterations without ever touching the mouse.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Do the shortcuts wrap around?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">No. When you reach the last hunk, pressing A or R does nothing until new changes appear.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Can I customize the keys?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Not yet, but A and R are the universal standard for accept/reject in many tools.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Do shortcuts work on mobile?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">No, but mobile users have large, easy-to-tap buttons instead.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">Two keys.
