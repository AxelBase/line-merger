The “Use as Base” button turns the Line-by-Line Merger into a powerful iterative tool.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">How It Works</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">After you finish reviewing and accepting the changes you want, click “Use as Base”. The current Final Result instantly becomes the new left-side text, and all decisions are reset. You can now paste a third version on the right and continue merging — building up the file exactly how you want, one controlled step at a time.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1li990r">Real-World Example</h3> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Imagine updating a large configuration file in stages: first apply security fixes, then performance tweaks, then new features. Instead of trying to review everything at once, you apply each batch separately, verifying the result before moving on.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Why This Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Complex changes are easier to reason about when broken into smaller, focused reviews. Iterative merging reduces cognitive load and dramatically lowers the chance of mistakes. You never lose work — each approved version becomes the new foundation.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Does it keep my previous decisions?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">No — decisions are cleared so you start fresh with the new base.
