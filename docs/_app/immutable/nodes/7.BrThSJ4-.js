These states are the foundation of how the tool produces a clean, accurate final result with zero ambiguity.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">The Three Decision States</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">When a hunk first appears, it is marked as pending. This means no decision has been made yet. By default, pending hunks behave exactly like rejected hunks — the original base text is kept. This ensures that if you close the page without reviewing everything, you get the original version back.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1al8b51">Accept: Apply the Change</h3> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">When you click Accept on a hunk or individual line, the tool records that decision. All added lines from that hunk will appear in the final result, and removed lines will be omitted. The visual feedback changes immediately: accepted additions turn bright green and stay visible.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1al8b51">Reject: Keep the Original</h3> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Clicking Reject tells the tool to ignore the proposed in this hunk entirely. Removed lines are kept, added lines are discarded, and the hunk gets a strikethrough style to show it has been deliberately declined.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1al8b51">Pending: Treated as Rejected</h3> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Any hunk still marked pending when you export or copy the result is automatically treated as rejected. This fail-safe design means you never accidentally include unwanted changes.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">How the Final Result Is Built</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The merger reconstructs the file from scratch on every change. It starts with the base text, walks through every hunk in order, and applies only the accepted additions. Everything else — rejected or pending — preserves the original lines. This guarantees the output is always correct and predictable.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Can I change my mind after deciding?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Yes.
