You paste two versions of any text file — whether it’s code, documentation, configuration, or plain writing — and the tool instantly shows you every change, one line at a time. You then decide, line by line or hunk by hunk, whether to keep the old version (reject) or apply the new change (accept). The final merged result updates instantly as you work.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why This Tool Exists</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Not everyone has Git installed. Not every device allows terminal access. Sometimes you just need to quickly compare and merge two text snippets from email, chat, or a web form. This merger solves that exact problem: no installation, no accounts, no data sent to servers — everything happens locally in your browser.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">How It Feels Like GitHub</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The interface deliberately mimics GitHub’s PR review screen. Green lines are additions, red lines are removals, and you get Accept and Reject buttons right next to each change. You can switch between inline view (like unified diff) and side-by-side view (perfect for prose or structured data). The moment you make a decision, the Final Result panel on the right updates automatically.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Privacy by Design</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Because the entire diff engine runs in your browser using pure JavaScript, nothing you paste ever leaves your device. This makes it safe for sensitive configuration files, internal documentation, or any content you don’t want uploaded anywhere.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Do I need Git or GitHub to use it?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">No. The tool works with any plain text — no Git knowledge required.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can I merge large files?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes. The tool handles files up to tens of thousands of lines, limited only by browser memory.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Does it work offline?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes. Once loaded, it works completely offline — perfect for airplanes or restricted networks.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">This tool brings the power of interactive merging to everyone, everywhere, instantly.</p></article></div>');function A(m){var e=k();b("1tq17n3",d=>{var a=q(),h=v(y(a),6);t(4),n(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),g(()=>{f.title="What is a Line-by-Line Accept/Reject Merger? | Merger Blog"}),i(d,a)});var s=r(e),u=r(s);t(4),o(s),t(2),o(e),n(()=>l(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{A as component,T as universal};
