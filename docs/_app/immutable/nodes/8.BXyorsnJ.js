Both are available with a single click, and each excels in specific situations.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Inline View – The GitHub Classic</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">In Inline view, changes appear exactly where they occur in the file. Added lines are shown in green with a plus sign, removed lines in red with a minus sign, and unchanged lines provide context. This is the default view most developers know from GitHub pull requests. It is perfect when you want to see the flow of the document as it will finally appear.</p> <h3 class="svelte-led0iy">Best For</h3> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Inline view shines when reviewing prose, Markdown documents, or any content where reading order matters more than structural comparison. It lets you focus on the final reading experience while still seeing exactly what was added or removed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Side-by-Side View – Structural Clarity</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">In Side-by-Side view, the old version appears on the left and the new version on the right, line by line. Empty cells clearly show what was added or removed. This layout makes it instantly obvious when lines have moved, when indentation changed, or when entire blocks were inserted or deleted.</p> <h3 class="svelte-led0iy">Best For</h3> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Side-by-Side is ideal for configuration files, JSON, YAML, package manifests, or any structured data where alignment and whitespace are meaningful. It also helps when comparing two very different versions where context lines rarely match.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Switching Instantly</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">You can toggle between views at any time, even in the middle of a review. The Accept and Reject buttons work exactly the same in both modes — your decisions are preserved no matter which view you prefer.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Which view is faster?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Both render instantly. The choice is purely about readability for the content you are merging.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Can I start in one view and finish in another?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Yes. Many users start in Side-by-Side to understand structure, then switch to Inline to verify final flow.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Does one view show more context?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">No. Both views include the same surrounding unchanged lines for full context.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Choose the view that matches your content — the tool adapts to you.</p></article></div>');function E(h){var e=I();g("led0iy",p=>{var i=S(),v=m(w(i),6);t(4),n(()=>r(v,"content",`${d??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),f(()=>{u.title="Side-by-Side vs Inline View: When to Use Each | Merger Blog"}),a(p,i)});var s=l(e),y=l(s);t(4),o(s),t(2),o(e),n(()=>r(y,"href",`${d??""}/blog`)),a(h,e)}export{E as component,V as universal};
