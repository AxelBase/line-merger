Here are some of the most common and creative ways people use it.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Configuration Files</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Updating package.json, docker-compose.yml, or CI configuration is risky when done manually. Paste the old and new versions, reject unwanted dependency bumps or syntax changes, and download a safe result — all without Git.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Documentation and Markdown</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Technical writers collaborate by emailing Markdown drafts. The merger lets them see exactly what changed, accept improvements, and reject formatting mistakes before committing.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Translations and Localization</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Translators deliver updated language files. Teams use the merger to verify no keys were accidentally deleted and that only translation strings changed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Creative Writing and Poetry</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Authors revising drafts love the inline view — it reads like a final document while still showing exactly what was added or removed between revisions.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Data Files and Spreadsheets</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">CSV, TSV, or JSON arrays exported from tools are compared side-by-side to catch missing rows or reordered columns instantly.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Can I share a merge session?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Yes — just copy both input texts and the result. Everything is plain text.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Is it suitable for legal documents?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Many users compare contract revisions successfully thanks to clear visual diff and full privacy.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Any file type it cannot handle?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Only binary files. Everything text-based works perfectly.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">One tool. Countless workflows.
